## Mount Rainier National Park Trip - 1 Day

Hello Friends, we hope you all are doing well.

We planned a day trip to Mount Rainier National Park, WA, USA, in June 2021. Trip to Mount Rainier was a bonus part of our 5 days long [Oregon trip](../../post/2021-06-30-usa-oregon-trip) and we had a lot of fun there.

We want to share what we liked at National Park & hope it will help you to plan a memorable trip.

## Day 1 - Mount Rainier National Park
There are multiple entry points of Mount Rainier National Park







-------------old data------------

We decided to visit falls at [Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/crgnsa/home). There are several mesmerizing falls along the Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area; the ones we liked are:

- [Multnomah Falls](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=30026)
- [Wahkeena Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29998)
- [Horsetail Falls & Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29934)

If you have to select only one, the best option will be {{< hl-text cyan >}}Multnomah Falls{{< /hl-text >}}. However, it remains a little crowded but still worth visiting there. There is an easy walking trail that will take you to the viewing deck, and from there, the falls view is stunning. You can continue on the trail and go to the top of fall for spectacular views if you wish. More details about the trail: [Alltrails - Multnomah Falls ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/multnomah-falls-trail)

If you want to grab a quick bite or want to go to the restroom, the [Multnomah lodge](https://www.multnomahfallslodge.com/) is nearby. It has restrooms, gift shop and remains open to public.

**Tip**: There are very few parking spots available right by Multnomah Falls (If you are reaching there using google maps/GPS), you won't find a spot available even midday on weekdays. Instead, park in the larger lot by the highway exit and take the walking trail to the falls.

Next stop [Tamanawas Falls trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/tamanawas-falls-trail), our initial plan was to pack the lunch and eat at the end of the 4-mile hike tail with gorgeous views of Tamanawas falls waterfall, but we had to skip it as we spent a good amount of time at Multnomah Falls. If you get the chance, try including this stop in your itinerary.

After that we head over to [Trillium lake](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=53634), we drove pretty much to the lake and then hiked around the lake which was around 1-1.5 miles. We were able to capture gorgeous reflections of Mount Hood.

The next stop on our list was [Timberline Lodge](https://www.timberlinelodge.com/). If you are an enthusiast in ski/snowboarding, this is a must-go. Timberline Lodge is one of the iconic lodges and was constructed in 1937. If you plan to call it a day after long walks, it is a good place to stay & recharge.
