## Hello Friends, Hope yâ€™all are doing well.

We planned the road trip of Oregon, USA in the month of June 2021. It was our first travel after the Covid-19 restrictions, and we really enjoyed every moment of our trip. The splendid coastline, natural forests, lakes, mountains, Oregon state has everything that a traveler wish to see.

We want to share our 5 days itinerary, hope it will help you to plan a perfect Oregon trip.

## Transportation
Flight from DFW to Portland International Airport(PDX) and from there we rented a car to start the journey.


## Day 0 - Flight from DFW to PDX
We booked an evening connecting flight from Dallas(DFW) to Seattle(SEA) to Portland International Airport(PDX). Flight experience was something different, so I must have to tell. Our flight from DFW to SEA to PDX was booked through Alaska airline, since alaska DFW flights were cancelled that day, so they rebooked us on American airline. 

We boarded the American airline flight on-time and everything was fine till the plane reached the runway. We were told there is some technical issue with Air-conditioner and should resolve quickly. After sitting for hours on a hot without Air-conditioning flight, they finally asked to get down and board a different American airline flight and that too from a different terminal. 

While we were waiting on flight, we got chance to see the cockpit and talk with pilot and crew members. They were very polite and caring, the pilot gave me a private tour too of the cockpit. We reached Seattle airport at around 3 AM and there was no more flight available to PDX, we had to sleep at airport to catch next available flight of 6 AM to Portland.   

> Quite a start of the adventurous trip ahead :)

## Day 1 - Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area & Mount hood
We decided to visit falls at [Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/crgnsa/home). There are several mesmerizing falls along the way, the ones we liked are:

- [Multnomah Falls](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=30026)
- [Wahkeena Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29998)
- [Horsetail Falls & Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29934)

If you have to select only one, best option will be {{< hl-text cyan >}}Multnomah Falls{{< /hl-text >}}. Although it remains little crowded but still a worth visiting there. There is an easy walking trail that will take you to viewing deck and from there the falls view is really beautiful. If you wish you can continue on the trail and go to top of fall for spectacular views. More details about the trail: [Alltrails - Multnomah Falls ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/multnomah-falls-trail) 

If you want to grab a quick bite or want to go to restroom, the [Multnomah lodge](https://www.multnomahfallslodge.com/) is nearby. It has restrooms, gift shop and open to public.

{{< alert success >}}
**Tip**: There are very few parking spots available right by Multnomah Falls (If you are reaching there using google maps/GPS), you won't find a spot available even midday on weekdays. Instead, park in the larger lot by the highway exit and take the walking trail to the falls.

Next stop [Tamanawas Falls trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/tamanawas-falls-trail), our intial plan was to pack the lunch and eat at the end of the 4 mile hike tail with gorgeous views of Tamanawas falls waterfall but we had to skip it as we spent good amount of time at Multnomah Falls. If you get chance, try including it in your itinerary. 

After that we head over to [Trillium lake](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=53634), we drove pretty much to the lake and then hiked around the lake which was around 1-1.5 miles. We were able to capture very beautiful reflection of Mount Hood and the lake.

{{< image classes="fancybox fig-100" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51601286493_7dec8d0aed_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51601286493_7dec8d0aed_o.jpg" >}}&nbsp;

Next stop in our list was [Timberline Lodge](https://www.timberlinelodge.com/). If you want are interested in ski/snow boarding, this is place to go. Timberline lodge is one of iconic lodge and was constructed in 1937. If you are planning to call it day after long walks, it is good place to stay & recharge.  We moved ahead towards our next destination [Smith rock state park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=36). It has beautiful [trails and hikes](https://smithrock.com/hike). If you are planning to visit, atleast keep 2-3 hours for it and enjoy the sunset there.

### Accommodation
- If you are planning to spend more time near at Mount Hood area then staying at Timberline Lodge is best option.
- Since we moved toward Smith rock state Park, we decided to call it a day near Prineville, OR 97754. Lots of good hotels options are available here.
