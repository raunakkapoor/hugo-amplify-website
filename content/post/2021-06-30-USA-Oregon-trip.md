## Oregon Road Trip Itinerary - 6 Days

Hello Friends, we hope you all are doing well.

We planned the trip to Oregon, USA, in June 2021. It was our first travel after the Covid-19 restrictions, and we enjoyed every moment of our journey. Oregon has everything a traveler wishes to see with the splendid coastline, natural forests, lakes, and mountains.

We want to share our five-day itinerary; we hope it will help you plan a perfect Oregon trip.

{{< google_mymap "https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Fcy6i3bKHkGRYGTwlo0m62rorjl55LmB" >}}

## Transportation
We took a flight from DFW to Portland International Airport(PDX) and then rented a car for our road trip.


## Day 0 - Flight from DFW to PDX
We booked an evening connecting flight from Dallas(DFW) to Seattle(SEA) to Portland International Airport(PDX). The flight experience was something different, so we must have to tell. Our flight from DFW to SEA to PDX was booked through Alaska Airline; since alaska DFW flights were cancelled that day, so they rebooked us on American airline.

We boarded the American Airlines flight on time, and everything was fine till the plane reached the runway. We were told there is some technical issue with Air-conditioner and it should resolve quickly. After sitting for hours on a hot without Air-conditioning flight, they finally asked to get down and board a different American airline flight and that too from an other terminal.

While we were waiting on the flight, we saw the cockpit and talked with the pilot and crew members. They were very polite and caring; the pilot gave us a private tour of the cockpit. We reached Seattle airport at around 3 AM, and there was no more flight available to PDX; we had to sleep at the airport to catch the next available flight of 6 AM to Portland.


> Quite a start of the adventurous trip ahead :)

## Day 1 - Mount Rainier National Park, WA
Initially, we thought to keep this trip only for Oregon, but we fall in love with mesmerizing Mount Rainier National Park and planned to spend at least one day there. As there were a lot of things to cover, we have added our day1 adventures [here](../../post/2021-06-29-usa-washington-trip).


## Day 2 - Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area & Mount hood
We decided to visit falls at [Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/crgnsa/home). There are several mesmerizing falls along the Columbia river gorge National Scenic Area; the ones we liked are:

- [Multnomah Falls](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=30026)
- [Wahkeena Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29998)
- [Horsetail Falls & Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29934)

If you have to select only one, the best option will be {{< hl-text cyan >}}Multnomah Falls{{< /hl-text >}}. However, it remains a little crowded but still worth visiting there. There is an easy walking trail that will take you to the viewing deck, and from there, the falls view is stunning. You can continue on the trail and go to the top of fall for spectacular views if you wish. More details about the trail: [Alltrails - Multnomah Falls ](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/multnomah-falls-trail)

If you want to grab a quick bite or want to go to the restroom, the [Multnomah lodge](https://www.multnomahfallslodge.com/) is nearby. It has restrooms, gift shop and remains open to public.


{{< alert success >}}
**Tip**: There are very few parking spots available right by Multnomah Falls (If you are reaching there using google maps/GPS), you won't find a spot available even midday on weekdays. Instead, park in the larger lot by the highway exit and take the walking trail to the falls.  
{{< /alert >}}

{{< youtube GyKWxpE6Pwk >}}

Next stop [Tamanawas Falls trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/tamanawas-falls-trail), our initial plan was to pack the lunch and eat at the end of the 4-mile hike tail with gorgeous views of Tamanawas falls waterfall, but we had to skip it as we spent a good amount of time at Multnomah Falls. If you get the chance, try including this stop in your itinerary.

After that we head over to [Trillium lake](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=53634), we drove pretty much to the lake and then hiked around the lake which was around 1-1.5 miles. We were able to capture gorgeous reflections of Mount Hood.

{{< image classes="fancybox fig-100" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51601286493_7dec8d0aed_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51601286493_7dec8d0aed_o.jpg" >}}&nbsp;

The next stop on our list was [Timberline Lodge](https://www.timberlinelodge.com/). If you are an enthusiast in ski/snowboarding, this is a must-go. Timberline Lodge is one of the iconic lodges and was constructed in 1937. If you plan to call it a day after long walks, it is a good place to stay & recharge.

## Day 5 - McKenzie River Trail Falls, Sea Lion Cave & Oregon Coastline

A new beautiful day began by visiting falls at McKenzie River Trail. It was pretty refreshing; trails were marked correctly & easy to walk.
- [Koosah and sahalie falls](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/koosah-and-sahalie-falls-trail)
- [Blue Pool - Tamolitch fall](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/tamolitch-blue-pool-via-mckenzie-river-trail)
- [Proxy fall](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/proxy-falls)

{{< image classes="fancybox fig-50" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608287806_48681cfce1_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608287806_48681cfce1_o.jpg" >}}
{{< image classes="fancybox fig-50" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608944574_cc0ec0fb9f_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608944574_cc0ec0fb9f_o.jpg" >}}&nbsp;

The next stop was famous America's largest [Sea lion cave](http://www.sealioncaves.com/); we reached just 5 mins before closing time and could get in. It's a natural cave, and sea lions are free to come and go anytime. We found some sea lions were inside the cave, and others were resting outside. Overall it was a fun place to spend time and see sea lions in their natural habitat.

{{< image classes="fancybox fig-50" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51607398557_f3e99d6d25_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51607398557_f3e99d6d25_o.jpg" >}}
{{< image classes="fancybox fig-50" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608875934_4826294e63_o.jpg" thumbnail="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51608875934_4826294e63_o.jpg" >}}&nbsp;

{{< youtube -HcQdb2spRY >}}

After that, we finally arrived at the splendid Oregon coastline. The first stop was Heceta Head Lighthouse State Scenic Viewpoint and the nearby beach area. When we reached Heceta Head Lighthouse, it was closed, so we had over to the beach and had a wonderful time there. The water was so clean and cold; every moment we spent there was mesmerizing.

{{< youtube 2ekx2Geba5I >}}

We ate our packed dinner at the Neptune State Scenic Viewpoint, watching the Sunset. It was the best moment of our trip. {{< alert success >}}
**Tip**: Neptune State Scenic Viewpoint is one of the best places to see the Sunset. Significantly less crowd, clean beach, and perfect full view of Sunset make it breathtaking.
{{< /alert >}}

##### Accommodation
- After a beautiful day, we spend the night at Dublin House Motel -Yachats, Oregon. There are multiple good hotels on Yachts, and all of them are near beaches.


## Day 6 - Oregon Coastline scenic points, Coast Aquarium & Canon Beach
So we finally reached the last day of our trip. We enjoyed every bit of the previous four days and wanted to make the last day memorable. We started the day by visiting the popular scenic points.

- Thor's Well
- Cape Perpetua Overlook
- Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area

After that, we head over to [Oregon Coast Aquarium](https://aquarium.org/); it is home to many aquatic animals like Sea Otters, Harbor Seals, Sea Lions, and even sharks. We had a great time there, and if you are with kids, it is a must place to visit. A quick video that I capture of jellyfish. Do you know jellyfish is not a fish :)

{{< youtube BZiudIkCc0w >}}

The last stop was Canon beach, where we spent most of the time just walking on sand. It is a crowded beach but still lovely. We had fun there.

{{< youtube FOwmo3LOLMI >}}

After that, we headed over to PDX airport and found again that Alaska Airlines flight was canceled. They rebooked us on American Airlines; luckily, American Airlines flight was not canceled or delayed, and thus we safely returned to our hometown Dallas.

We hope you find this post useful. See you on the next adventure!!
